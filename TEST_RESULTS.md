## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Testing on Real Hardware:
1. Connect buzzer to GPIO 17 (Physical Pin 11)
2. Connect relay to GPIO 27 (Physical Pin 13)
3. Run test on Raspberry Pi with `sudo python3 test_gpio_standalone.py`
4. Verify physical devices respond correctly

### For API Testing:
1. Start backend: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Access Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
3. Test GPIO endpoints under "gpio" tag
4. Use provided cURL/Python examples from README.md

### For Integration:
1. Add GPIO controller to agent's main loop
2. Configure WebSocket connection from agent to backend
3. Test end-to-end control via API
4. Create frontend UI for GPIO control
